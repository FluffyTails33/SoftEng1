Get all products

```http
  GET `${BASE_URL}/api/products/all`
```

Sure, I can help you improve your API documentation. Here are some suggestions:

- You can add a **description** section to explain what the endpoint does and what parameters it returns.
- You can add a **request** section to specify the query parameters or Custom Headers that the endpoint expects.
- You can add a **response** section to list the possible status codes and response body fields that the endpoint returns.
- You can use a **table** format to display the fields in a structured way.
- You can add a **sample response** section under the **response** section and use a code block to display the JSON response.

Here is a possible improved documentation for your endpoint:
